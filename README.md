## 🛠️ From the Developer  

This game was built during a full month of focused work — I even took vacation time just to dive in.  
The main goals were to **learn Vanilla JS for WebXR** and to practice **Git branch merging**,  
using a structure of `FEATURE → MODULE → SOLUTION` for cleaner development.  

### 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Languages & APIs**: Vanilla JS, WebGL2, WebAudio, OpenXR  
- **Packaging**: 7zip (PPMd algorithm)  

### ✨ Key Features  
- MMO mode (via Cloudflare relay server)  
- Cross-platform: VR, mobile, and desktop  
- Unified input system (raytraced controls)  
- Adaptive music system  
- Wind simulation (affecting sound, grass, and plants)
