## 🛠️ From Developer

This game was built during a full month of focused work — I took vacation time to dive in.
The main goals were to:
 **Vanilla JS for WebXR** - no frameworks, just raw JS browser APIs
 **Cross-platform** - VR, mobile, and desktop
 **13kB limit**

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages & APIs**: `html`,`JS`, `WebGL2`, `WebAudio`, `OpenXR`
- **Packaging**: `7zip` (`PPMd` algorithm)

### ✨ Key Features
- Cross-platform: VR, mobile, and desktop
- Unified input system (raytraced clicks)
- MMO mode (via Cloudflare relay server)
- Wind simulation (affecting sound, grass, and plants)
- Adaptive music system
- Pleasant visuals
